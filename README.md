# touchCalculator
Do the math! Manipulate equations on your android device. In honor of the math teacher S.E. who showed that calculating can be a mechanical thing.

# Milestones
1. Let the user learn calculus using gestures.
 * Solve for x using basic operators on a predefined set of example equations.
 * Show the user how to use the gestures by a tutorial.
2. Provide an equation/formula management tool.
 * Manually create equations
 * Import equations from Wikipedia.
 * Export equations to Latex. (maybe later other targets)
 * Select favorite equations/formulas.
 * Log each manipulation step by step. Allow the user to keep track of separate calculation cases. (The variable dividing an equation beeing non-zero.)
3. Offer a scientific tool.
 * Allow the user to create own 
 * Destinguish between scalar and vector/matrix variables and operators.
 * Handle physical units.
 * Provide a formula data base descibing all variables of an equation.
